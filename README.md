# auto-edit-chrome-uri

Wow, didn't think this would still be a problem.  
In September 2019 Google pushed a change to Chrome that removed the "Always remember" option from URIs opening binaries.


This is done as a security measure but still annoying that it's not even configurable in advanced options.  
At the time I was doing a desktop computer rollout for a few dozen users that needed URIs to be auto opening as each page of their web app would prompt to run the binary installed on their computer.  
Arguably poor design, but not really insecure, so I just rolled this powershell script out.  
Still works good today and Google have still not added a proper configuration for this.
